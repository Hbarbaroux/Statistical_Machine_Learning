# Statistical_Machine_Learning
This repository contains algorithm implementations based on the Advanced Statistical Inference course provided in Eurecom by Maurizio Filippone.

This course is based on a probabilistic data modeling approach and explores its mathematical and statistical background.

You will mainly find here algorithms based on a Bayesian fundation.
